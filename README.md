# Project ATEM - Physical Duel Disk (Arduino)


## Overview
This repo the NFC based Physical Duel Disk built to pair with the Project ATEM [Smart Duel Gazer](https://github.com/BramDC3/smart_duel_gazer) through the [Smart Duel Server](https://github.com/BramDC3/smart_duel_server).

## How it Works - The Basics
For the system to work, a card sleeve needs to be outfitted with an NFC chip. When the reader detects a chip it grabs the serial number of the card (which can be added using the built in '*write mode*' feature), checks a couple sensors to determine the position of the card, and then relays it to the Server.
